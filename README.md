# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Challenge
Based on the data, campaigns that meet or exceed their campaign goals tend to launch in May and June. In general, the greatest percentage of campaigns that are successful have a campaign goal of less than $1000. The greatest percentage fail when the campaign goal reaches between $15000 and $19999.

This dataset, however, does not account for the genre of theater plays related to these numbers. Additional analysis is recommended to determine if genre correlates with meeting / not meeting campaign goals in a stronger fashion than launch date or total campaign goal.
